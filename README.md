# 🎄 💻 ⛄️ Advent of Code 2019

🎅 has become stranded at the edge of the Solar System 🛰 while delivering presents to other planets ! To accurately calculate his position in space, safely align his warp drive, and return to 🌏 in time to save Christmas, he needs you to bring him measurements from fifty stars.

🚧 These solves are being done hastily during a lunch break or at the end of the day. I would suggest referencing another repo for more efficient solves! That said love to chat about the advent challenges. Reach out or/and join me in the `advent-of-code` BoroJS channel.
